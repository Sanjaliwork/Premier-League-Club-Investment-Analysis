**DOMAIN**: Sports (Football)

**OBJECTIVE**: The purpose of this exploratory data analysis is to identify potential investments in one of the top-performing English Premier League clubs. 
           Several established clubs are already owned by competitors, so the management of the firm is seeking to identify clubs with great potential for future success.

**DATA**: The dataset comprises crucial information about all the clubs that have participated in premier league tournaments. 
          Here is a data dictionary that outlines the information we have about the clubs and their performance.

**DATA DICTIONARY**:

## **KEY LEARNINGS**: 

**Data cleaning** is the process of identifying and correcting or removing errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in a dataset. 
Some variables may need data type conversion, converting the existing data to a particular format, and not all null values need to be replaced with mean/median/mode.
We need to treat the null values based on domain knowledge and formulate a default value.

**Outliers** are unusual values in your dataset which can distort statistical analyses. We identify and remove them during EDA. But, that’s not always the case.                      Removing the outliers might not provide us with the relevant insight we are looking for.

We built a **framework by assigning scores** to each club from the inference obtained during EDA, which led us to a conclusion. 
To avoid being deceived by the weightage result, a thorough examination of the whole dataset should be done by checking if there might be any columns or correlations to re-consider in the dataset.

**Feature engineering** refers to the process of using domain knowledge to select and transform the raw data into relevant information that can be used in the analysis. 
Some variables might be not relevant which gets transformed.

## **CONCLUSION**:

We concluded the analysis by recommending to invest in LEICESTER CITY!🏆

They have a proven track record of success and consistency. We believe that this club is well-positioned for success in the future.
